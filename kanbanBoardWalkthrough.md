# Objective
Provide project management resources on creating a GitHub issue and a KanBan board.

## GitHub issues

### Purpose
Based on GitHub Issue documentation, issues will assist with tracking ideas, feedback, tasks, or bugs for your portfolio projects. This will help to achieve greenlight status for the portfolio projects early on by following good practices on organizing tasks and reporting bugs.

### How to create a GitHub issue
GitHub Docs provides thorough documentation on creating GitHub issues, GitHub Issues Doc.
Upon filling in the information for the GH issue, you want to be as descriptive as possible. The title should explain quickly what the issue is mainly about. The body description should explain more in-depthly what the purpose of the issue is.




In the scope of adding GH Issues for the portfolio projects, you will want to start by creating a GH issue for each feature in the scorecard. It can be helpful to break down large issues into smaller tasks such as adding a new feature. You will want to create a new task inside the body field for each user action in the scope of CRUD functionality. You will check off each task once it has been completed and resolve the issue when all tasks have been checked.


## Kanban boards

### Purpose
Kanban board is an agile project management tool that helps visualize the status of the tasks. https://docs.github.com/en/issues/planning-and-tracking-with-projects/learning-about-projects/quickstart-for-projects
