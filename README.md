# Module 7 Welcome Pack

Welcome to Module 7! This repo is meant to hold convenient links for you to use during your capstone projects. In addition, this repo will also contain what to expect during the first two weeks of capstone projects. Note this is a living document, things will be continuously changed and updated as needed but capstone requirements WILL NOT change.

```txt
⚠️ IMPORTANT NOTE: If you are checking this out before your first capstone week officially begins please make sure you are keeping your pre-capstone project your top priority. All of this should be considered secondary until that project is done.
```

## The Big Picture

Capstone Project is an assessment to test your programming and software engineering skills. The main objective is to build a user-ready MVP *(Minimal Viable Product)* application within these two weeks from planning to having a deployed app. The minimum requirements to pass capstone is to have at least 2 core features with error validations and styling. The expectation is to have a completed MVP application first, then focus on refactoring to include additional features. This approach is known as Agile, whereas the Waterfall approach can be seen as completing one phase at a time before moving onto the next phase. Agile is an iterative approach where we deliver goals in small incremental amounts.

Please note, we want to aim for 4 features *(2 core and 2 bonus /or core)*, however the minimum to pass is **2 core *(CRUD)* features**. Students should have a clear road map of what should be their MVP first to pass then implement future goals.

# Phase 1 - Project Approval

## Capstone Project Proposals
You must submit the Google Project Proposal form and get an approval from a TA before starting on your capstone project. This will be due by Wednesday *(w21 d3)* before lunch. If you're currently waiting for a TA to review your project proposal, please utilize the time appropriately and continue to be productive *(initalize your project, set up your github repo, project kanban board, etc.)*. Also, the mod 7 staff will post a thread in the Online Slack Channel. Please respond to the thread once you have submitted your project proposal and we will review them based on the order given.

*Note- Any project proposal without all the required wiki documentations will be disapproved and asked to complete it.*

<!--
```txt
⚠️ IMPORTANT NOTE: If you are checking this out before your first capstone week officially begins you are welcome to fill out this form but you will have to fill it out again on Monday / Tuesday officially.
```
-->

Here are some capstone project ideas that tend to be associated with success in the observations of the TAs, but of course they are not a guarantee of success. Please note ***these are in no particular order*** and you are absolutely ***not required to choose one of these*** projects. This list may guide your thought process as much or as little as you feel is appropriate. Please note that **multiple user types are not allowed**. *(Ex- Business owner and customers)*

## Projects We've Seen Go Well
* Etsy
* Facebook
* Quora
* AirBnB
* Reddit
* Yelp
* Eventbrite
* Medium

### Projects that can look fantastic without AWS:
* TodoList (Remember the Milk but with a more modern UI)
* New York Times Recipes
* Untapped
* Trello
* AirBnB
* Medium
* Evernote
* HipCamp
* Eventbrite
* Reddit
* Yelp

### Projects that we strongly suggest have AWS:

* E-commerce sites where users upload “products”, *(Etsy, Fiverr, Ebay)* <!-- (Products & Reviews suggested; if choosing Orders/Purchases, Cart can’t be a MVP core CRUD) example sites: Etsy, Fiverr, Ebay, etc… -->
* Pinterest
* Flikr
* FaceBook

### Projects We've Seen Students Struggle With:

* Soundcloud (AWS strongly suggested)
* Spotify (AWS strongly suggested)
* Venmo (AWS optional / CRUD features are tricky)
* Robinhood (AWS optional / CRUD features are tricky)
* YouTube (AWS strongly suggested)
* Netflix (AWS optional / CRUD features are tricky)
* Game Apps (AWS optional / CRUD features are tricky)
* Disney + (AWS optional / CRUD features are tricky)
* E-commerce sites that need Cart & Orders/Purchases
* Slack (w/ Websockets)

<!-- ## E-Commerce Apps
E-commerce websites *(Ebay, Etsy, etc.)* where users upload “products” will require Products & Orders as first two core features.
Other E-commerce apps *(Amazon, any brand sites, etc)* where users don't upload "products" will require Reviews & Orders/Purchases as core features. Shopping cart
can not be its own core CRUD feature, this can be a bonus feature that ties together with the Orders feature. Please note that **multiple user types are not allowed**. *(Ex- Business owner and customers)* -->

## Projects that are not allowed
* Instagram
* Twitter
* Discord
* Projects that the student has already done before in previous modules.

## NPM Packages
**Please Note: Any outside curriculum NPM packages implemented without your PM's approval is a risk of having to refactor your code**

* Any NPM package *(outside curriculum)* needs to be approved by your **Project Manager**
* CSS frameworks *(Bootstrap, MaterialUI, etc.)* are **not allowed**

*Please note, any questions related to third-party API's (AWS, Google Maps, Socket.io, NPM Packages, etc.) that are outside of curriculum is the student's responsibility to debug. TA's may offer advice/guidance but are not expected to help debug.*

> Please note: Each Module has their own set of regulations that is specific to its own. NPM packages may have been approved in previous Modules, however some may not be approved in Mod 7. Students can always revisit previous projects after final grade is completed or during Job Search to implement any NPM packages. 

### List of Approved NPM Packages
**The NPM packages listed below are already approved, free feel to implement these into your projects**

- Boto3 (AWS)
- Google Maps (@reach/combobox, @react-google-maps/api, use-places-autocomplete...)
- Moment.js
- WaveSufer.js
- Websockets (i.e socket.io)
- multer
- aws-sdk

## Appropriate Project Themes

When picking your capstone project theme use common sense and think about it from the perspective of a recruiter and your future job coach. Our goal is not to censor your creativity or discourage you but we do have an official policy on appropriate project themes linked below and we encourage you all to check it out. Recently the most common issues are with projects related to weed / cannabis. We can't approve projects related to these themes because of federal legality, but that doesn't mean you can't pursue these projects after capstones.

* [Project Theme Expectations](https://github.com/tombetthauser/module-7-welcome/blob/main/Project%20Theme%20Expectations%20-%20Student%20Facing%20Discussion.pdf)


<!-- ---
## Minimul Viable Product / Project

Remember, a minimum viable product is the absolute least you can put out that is also a usable product. For your capstone project this means 2 fully functional CRUD features with validation error messages that are unequivocally intuitive and simple to use by someone who has never seen the app before.
Remember, a successful capstone project does not need AWS, Google Maps, Web Sockets or more than 2 CRUD features. But the 2 CRUD features that you do build need to feel and function complete to pass. Essentially, this image says it all both for your capstone project and future projects in your career. If image files could be made out of solid gold, it would be. Keep it in mind always.

# Phase 2 - Project Development

## Daily Standups

You will have daily stand ups with your Project Manager. Daily standups will take place between groups of 3-5 students from your circle. Each student will take roughly 5-10 minutes to screen-share their **deployed app** and **code**. Students are expected to explain what they worked on Heroku and then explain the code and data-flow afterwards. Specific standup times will always be announced in your circle channel. Your PM will ask a small handful of questions while taking brief notes that are shared with the rest of the module 7 team as well as the PTMs and the Career Quest team.

### Questions For Students:

*Please note that all work must be shown on Heroku, not localhost. We can not determine the progression of your project based on localhost alone*
* What progress did you make on your goal from yesterday?
* What is your goal for today that you plan to complete before next standup? 
* Can you walkthrough the code base of the feature you worked on?

### Additional Questions That May Be Asked For Students:
* When did you last deploy?
* Is all the code you are showing deployed?
* Does your Project Manager approve of the goal?
* What is your project status in terms of user stories?

### Other Standup Notes

* If **technical questions come up**, your PM will ask you to put them in the lecture questions channel as we will not have time to debug during standups.
* TA notes will include whether you met yesterdays goal fully / partially / not at all.
* TA notes will also include 3-5 word description of your goal for tomorrow.

## Workflow Expectations

### Complete ONE FEATURE before moving on to the next.
* Expected General Workflow:
    * DB Tables => Backend Routes => Frontend Components => Error Handling => Styling

> This general workflow is what's to be expected and will help with understanding how the data flow works from the backend to the frontend.
    
### CSS Styling
* Do not leave any default styling for HTML elements such as buttons, inputs, textareas, etc.
* CSS must look as if you have made a valiant effort. You are not expected to be a designer, but attention to spacing, font, layout must be apparent.
* Your site must be intuitive to the user. User must not have to hunt and guess how to navigate and use your app.

### GitHub 
* Utilize creating a KanBan Board on Github to effectively manage your time in completing tasks and objectives.
* Make sure to push to GitHub daily. *(We want to see that garden green)*
* You are encouraged to use branches to complete your features and to push to your main branch when you have working functionality.
   * Please remember to test the feature not only on local, but on Production *(Heroku)* as well to ensure it works as expected.

## Lecture Questions Emoji System

Because the TA's are asked to answer all questions asynchronously when possible and because capstone issues can often take hours to address. The TA's will use slack reaction emojis to communicate the status of your question. Please pay attention to these emojis and consider them official communication. If it seems odd to take emojis seriously welcome to the tech world!

# 👀
The eyeballs mean the TA's are aware of the question and are looking into it / discussing it in the Staff Room. There may be other questions ahead of yours and it make take time to resolve the question based on the complexity of the problem and how clear the question was, if screenshots or commits were provided etc.

# ✅
The green check means that a TA or the student has confirmed that the question has been resolved. If this isn't correct tag one of the TA's in the thread or re-post the question.

# ☑️
The gray or blue check means the question seems to have been resolved by a TA or other student but is awaiting some form of confirmation.

# ⚠️ or ❌
The alert emoji means the question may not be specific enough or may not show clear evidence of independent student research on AAO, Stack Overflow, Google etc. Please do not interpret this in any negative way. Do not hesitate to ask questions, TA's are here to help and guide in answering questions. Fomulating good questions is a great skill to aquire as a software engineer and it does take practice. So, don't hesitate!

Before the TA's can effectively address the question, the student will need to add more information, screenshots, a description of what you have done so far in terms of research and solution attempts and/or a link to the repo with a recent commit message clearly describing the issue.

Once you have revised the question, tag the TAs or re-post a new version of the question in the lecture questions channel.

### Good Question Template

To ensure the quickest possible response to a question you are encouraged to literally copy, paste and fill this out when asking a question in slack. The Mod 7 team may ask you to do so if it seems like it might help expedite answering your question.

1. What are you working on? (give us some context)
2. Describe the problem (what are you trying to do? what is it currently doing?)
3. What error messages do you have? (server/front-end console, *if there is one*)
4. What have you done to debug? What have you searched/tried? (THIS IS VERY HELPFUL TO DESCRIBE)
5. Relevant code snippets/screenshots (crop, mark-up, or explain them)

# Phase 2.5 - Peer Review

Peer Review will start on Friday of the first week of capstone everyday after lunch, at 12:30 PT / 3:30 EST. This can also be viewed on the [Mod 7 Online Google Calender](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/u/0/embed?src=c_al83m9o7es4b69frh3mk41ia68@group.calendar.google.com&ctz=America/Los_Angeles) as well. Students will get assigned a pair, posted to Slack everyday, to review each other's code. Below are guidelines to help illustrate how peer review will work. Please note, during this hour, instructors will not be available for questions on Slack.

*Note- We will also do an EOD demo the day before peer review starts.*

> This exercise is helpful to practice remembering what your code does for when an interviewer or coworker asks you to explain parts of your code. Also this helps you practice _articulating_ your code which will **majorly** help you in interviews and on the job!

## Steps:

1. Choose who goes first. You each get 30 minutes and have a timer set up.
2. Find a part of your code to walk through.
    - Could be a part you are proud of, something new, your redux store, your routes, your components, your CSS, etc...
    - Could be something you are only partially done making and then go into some basic "pseudocode" of what your next steps will be.
        - Try to stay focused on code you do have, though. If your partner has a solution for a problem or something, it’s ok to discuss if it’s quick and write down notes (or plan to meet up afterward).
3. Begin walking line by line, explaining the work flow of your code.
    - You don't have to start at the very beginning of each file, but could choose which parts to go through.

## Things to consider:

1. This **IS NOT** time to debug or code.
2. Both sides are responsible for getting equal time to review.
3. Students are responsible to give and receive constructive feedback and commit to the exercise.
4. IA’s will be jumping in rooms periodically to check progress and could possibly ask questions! 
5. Students will receive strikes if not commited to the exercise *(webcam is off, no discussions, etc)*

## Tips:

1. Write down notes of things you notice about your own code.       
     - Mistakes, things you missed, things you want to change, etc...
2. Pay attention to the way your partner has coded things.
    - Seeing how others code can give new ideas! Or solve a problem you already have!
3. Please use code-centric instead of human-centric language. _(refer back to AOO Week 2 Day 2 “Empathetic Communication” for a refresher!)_
4. Ask clarifying questions of your partner when they are explaining.
5. Take notice on how your partner read and understood your code so that you could gauge your work’s readability. 
6. If your partner did have a hard time reading a line/snippet of code, be sure to add comments to those to help you understand your code in the future. 
7. Take feedback as something constructive and helpful for improvement.(On the flip side, be aware of how you present constructive feedback)

---

# Phase 3 - Pregrading / Final Grading

## Pregrading
Pregrading will start on the **beginning of Thursday** at **9AM PT** on the second week of capstone development. Our grading process will be identical to the final grading process and students will receive pregrading scorecards. There are no requirements associated with pre-grading and it is expected that your project will not yet be passing but it is ideal for you to have your project nearly completed so we can point out as many bugs / corrections that will help make your project passing the following Monday when projects are due. And if your project passes at pregrading all you'll have to do is not break your site over the weekend! In addition, pre-grading will be a priority over answering questions in the lecture channel. TA's will still check periodically to help answer questions, and free feel to also help your peer's as well!

Please note that if the required core features are not deployed to Heroku by Pregrade, then TA's will be unable to leave any feedback. This will be the student's responsibility over the weekend to read the Error validation repo and Instructor Grade Google Slides to properly test the feature.

## Review Your Pregrade Scorecard
Students will receive an email associated with Progress Tracker of their scorecard after their capstone project is graded. If you did not receive an email by EOD, please reach out to a TA to confirm your email. On Friday, day after Pregrade, please reach out to your grader to ask clarifying questions and to ensure what you need to work on over the weekend. After fixing the corrections from the scorecard, please test on Production to ensure it works as expected.

*Note- we will do a scorecard demo of how the grading process looks like, two days before pregrading starts*

*Feel free to make a copy of the example scorecard and use it as a reference*
- [Example Scorecard](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/12ps73B8JscnRFp0nKv98Y6A2D825qhrvZMUYu5GToRs/edit?usp=sharing)

### Things to Consider
* You DO NOT have to create your own scorecard, your PM will do this for you.
* Upon final grading, you should see two tabs at the bottom of the scorecard Google spreadsheet labeled as "pregrade" and "final grade".
* Students are **expected** and **responsible** to test their Heroku app before final grading.
    * Test the CRUD functionality and User Auth on Heroku.
    * Check if the styling is consistent throughout the entire app.
    * Check to make sure all the general requirements are met *(Favicon, Readme, About Links, etc)*
    * Check to make sure error validations work as intended for user auth and all features *(check [Capstone Minimum Required Error Messages](https://github.com/whitnessme/capstone-minimum-required-error-messages) for more info)*
    * TA's will do their best to leave as much feedback as possible on pregrading, however **it is your responsibility to test your app**.
    * Please review [Instructor Notes on Project Grading](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1-kVQflM_bbgn1iUexymWY9z_imWYeqYCTcZlmsiFdmU/edit#slide=id.p)

## Final Grade
Students are required to present their capstone project on Heroku on Monday *(w23 d1)*. Students will have about 5-6 minutes to share their features and accomplishments. After presentations is over, students will transition to Career Quest, and the Mod 7 team will begin final grading students projects. TA's will revoke the shared access on scorecards and will share it again after it is graded. Under the Final Grade tab, students will see the status of their project, either as "pass" or "fail". Any project that is marked as "fail", will take a capstone academic deferral. Please do not view it as a negative outcome, but as an opportunity to extend your learning to gain more mastery, which is imperative in the job search. Students will receive a Slack Message from the Module 7 Lead if their project is "fail". 

## What's required in the Project ReadMe
* Project title
* Project description *(this can be a few sentences explaining what the app is)*
* Heroku Live Link
* Technologies Used *(Frontend and Backend)*
* MVP features
* Few screenshots, least *(1-2)*, to highlight the app
