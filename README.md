# Module 7: Welcome Starter Pack

Welcome to Module 7! This repo is meant to hold convenient links for you to use during your capstone projects, and to give a summarize compilation of project requirements. Note this is a living document, things will be continuously changed and updated as needed but capstone requirements WILL NOT change.

```txt
⚠️ IMPORTANT NOTE: If you are checking this out before your first capstone week officially begins please make sure you are keeping your pre-capstone project your top priority. All of this should be considered secondary until that project is done.
```

## Capstone Project Requirements
Projects must have a minimum of **2 working CRUD features** and **base requirements** *(User Auth)* completed by final grade *(W23 D1)*. Only the live site will be used for grading. 

![Scorecard](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/76798385/206231772-dc23dd10-72fa-4ea6-be20-66db7d9fcfe4.png)

**Ex. Project: Airbnb**
- Users (Auth): Create, Read 
1. Listings: Create, Read, Update, Destroy
2. Bookings: Create, Read, Destroy (Not Editable)
3. Reviews: Create, Read, Update, Destroy
4. Ratings: Create, Read (Not Editable, Destroyed with Reviews)
5. *Bonus* Search: Backend Fetch w/ Params (ideal), Frontend filtering. 
6. *Bonus* Google API: Integration

First feature has to be **full** CRUD. and the second feature can be **3/4** CRUD or full CRUD. In the example above, the bookings feature has create, read, and Delete. Ideally, update and delete performs the same action so this feature would be considered 3/4 CRUD.

[Example Scorecard Link](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1e5LgQ7u5oRDS8C2gr7hIciHSz1Tg6N1AhmErjLTM6JM/edit#gid=0)

Any questions about grading requirements, **please reference** the Instructor Grading Slides: [Instructor Notes on Project Grading](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1-kVQflM_bbgn1iUexymWY9z_imWYeqYCTcZlmsiFdmU/)

### Error Validations
A User should **NOT** be allowed to update or submit a form with blank or null input fields that are assumed to be required. All input fields within a form are assumed to be required and tested as such. If certain fields within a form are not required, then all required fields must be marked by a different CSS style or an asterisk (*) next to the label to indicate a required field.

Please refer to the Error Validations Repo for more examples.
[Required Error Messages](https://github.com/whitnessme/capstone-minimum-required-error-messages)

## The Big Picture

Capstone Project is an assessment to test your programming and software engineering skills. The main objective is to build a user-ready MVP *(Minimal Viable Product)* application within these two weeks from planning to having a deployed app. The ideal expectation is to have a completed MVP application done before feature review, then have the remaining time to focus on refactoring to include additional features. 

We want to make sure we are completing ONE FEATURE before moving on to the next. This feature-driven approach is known as an **agile** workflow, whereas the **waterfall** approach can be seen as completing one phase at a time before moving onto the next phase. Agile is an iterative approach where we deliver goals in small incremental amounts. An example of a waterfall workflow would be working on the entire backend first for all features then working on the frontend. 

[Agile vs Waterfall Link](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/blog/agile-vs-waterfall)

Students should have a clear road map during the planning phase of what should be their MVP's first to pass the minimum requirements then implement future goals. 

> The end goal is to have 4 features working. After graduation, to be greenlit you will need to have 4 features and the general requirements done.

## Mental Health Resources
Taking care of our mental health is an important aspect in our life. Please make sure to take breaks, meditate, sleep, or go for a walk outside to do what's best for you to reduce stress. Here are some resources provided that can be informative.

- [Imposter Syndrome](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1CA5UZwDisg_1WMQIurtDsj4vOkWlZ0cZ/edit)

- [Avoiding Burnout](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1viR9dO-xOJSF6ouLsLs4vqvC5Qhy8dZY/view?usp=sharing)

## Google Calendar

This calendar is a great resource to know what the day to day basis will look like. There should be a "+" button at the bottom right corner, please add this calendar to your own Google Calendar.
- [Module 7 Calendar Link](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/u/0/embed?src=c_al83m9o7es4b69frh3mk41ia68@group.calendar.google.com&ctz=America/Los_Angeles)

## Cheating
Students plagiarising another student's source code will be dismissed. This is an assessment to utilize the knowledge gained from the previous modules to build what you have learned.

## Camera Etiquacy
Students **MUST** have their cameras on during live lectures in Module 7, including during the Career Quest. Students who have their cameras off or are afk/not present <!--, or does not show the full face in the camera view --> , will receive a **strike**. Students who need to step away from the camera for a brief moment, please use the coffee reaction emoji on Zoom that says "I'm away". Students who need to be away from the camera for more than 15 minutes, please communicate with the staff. Students who may need to be cameras off for any special circumstance, please reach out to the Module 7 Staff. 

---

# Phase 1 - Project Approval

## Capstone Project Proposals
All students should have a **target website** they will clone. You must submit the Google Project Proposal form and get an approval from a TA before coding anything for the features on your capstone project. The deadline for all project proposals will have to be submitted by **end of lunch** on W21D2. 

If you're currently waiting for a TA to review your project proposal, please utilize the time appropriately and continue to be productive *(initalize your project + deploy starter, set up your github repo, project kanban board, etc.)*. Also, the mod 7 staff will post a thread in the Online Slack Channel. Please respond to the thread once you have submitted your project proposal, and IA's will review them based on the order given. Students will receive a green checkmark in the thread or a direct message if the project has been approved.

*Note- Any project proposal without all the required wiki documentations will be disapproved and asked to complete it.*

IA's will have open office hours during **Project Approval Phase** to help provide guidance on project proposals.

---
## Github Wiki Documentation Example Links
> User stories, Database Schema, MVP Features, Wireframes are _required._
* [Example User Stories (only first 2 features needs to be completed)](https://github.com/appacademy/Module-6-Resources/blob/main/group_project_resources/example_project_planning_docs/user_stories.md)
* [Example Schema (3-6 tables only for first 2 features needs to be completed)](https://github.com/chrisoney/mercenary-review/wiki/Database-Schema-and-Backend-Routes)
* [Example Features (4 CRUD features and 2 Bonus features needs to be defined)](https://github.com/crespohector/welcome-to-mod-7/wiki/Example-MVP-Feature-List)
* [Example Wireframes (Wireframes needed for first 2 features.)](https://github.com/crespohector/welcome-to-mod-7/wiki/Example-Wireframes)

*Note- Students that plan to update, add, or remove their user stories during project development needs to be approved by their Project Advisor.*

### Project Proposal Form
After the required wiki documentations are completed on GitHub, submit this project proposal form and respond to the thread on Slack.

[Project Proposal Form](https://forms.gle/7zJjvXKFh7sJNENM9)

Here are some capstone project ideas that tend to be associated with success in the observations of the TAs, but of course they are not a guarantee of success. Please note ***these are in no particular order*** and you are absolutely ***not required to choose one of these*** projects. This list may guide your thought process as much or as little as you feel is appropriate.

Please note that **multiple user types are not allowed**. *(Ex- Business owner and customers)*
> We want to diversify our project portfolio. If you already did a social media clone, then maybe try working on a traveling app or E-commerce app.

## Projects We've Seen Go Well
* Etsy
* Quora
* AirBnB
* Reddit
* Yelp
* Eventbrite
* Medium

### Projects that can look fantastic without AWS:
* TodoList (Remember the Milk but with a more modern UI)
* New York Times Recipes
* Untapped
* Trello
* AirBnB
* Medium
* Evernote
* HipCamp
* Eventbrite
* Reddit
* Yelp

### Projects that we strongly suggest have AWS:

* E-commerce sites where users upload “products”, *(Etsy, Fiverr, Ebay)*
* Pinterest
* Flikr
* FaceBook

### Projects We've Seen Students Struggle With:

* Soundcloud (AWS strongly suggested)
* Spotify (AWS strongly suggested)

## Using External Packages (NPM / PIP)
**Please Note: Any external packages implemented without your PM's approval is a risk of having to refactor your code**

* Any package *(outside curriculum)* needs to be approved by your **Project Manager**
* CSS frameworks *(Tailwind, Bootstrap, MaterialUI, etc.)* are **not allowed**
* No Copying and Pasting CSS code

*Any questions related to third-party API's (AWS, Google Maps, Socket.io, NPM Packages, etc.) that are outside of curriculum is the student's responsibility to debug. TA's may offer advice/guidance but are not expected to help debug.*

> Please note: Each Module has their own set of regulations that is specific to its own. NPM packages may have been approved in previous Modules, however some may not be approved in Mod 7. 

### List of Approved NPM Packages
**The NPM packages listed below are already approved, free feel to implement these into your projects**

- Boto3 (AWS)
- Google Maps (@reach/combobox, @react-google-maps/api, use-places-autocomplete...)
- Moment.js
- WaveSufer.js
- Websockets (i.e socket.io)
- multer

## Appropriate Project Themes

When picking your capstone project theme use common sense and think about it from the perspective of a recruiter and your future job coach. Our goal is not to censor your creativity or discourage you but we do have an official policy on appropriate project themes linked below. Recently, the most common issues are with projects related to weed / cannabis. We can't approve projects related to these themes because of federal legality, but that doesn't mean you can't pursue these projects after capstones.

* [Project Theme Expectations](https://github.com/tombetthauser/module-7-welcome/blob/main/Project%20Theme%20Expectations%20-%20Student%20Facing%20Discussion.pdf)

<!-- ---
## Minimul Viable Product / Project

Remember, a minimum viable product is the absolute least you can put out that is also a usable product. For your capstone project this means 2 fully functional CRUD features with validation error messages that are unequivocally intuitive and simple to use by someone who has never seen the app before.
Remember, a successful capstone project does not need AWS, Google Maps, Web Sockets or more than 2 CRUD features. But the 2 CRUD features that you do build need to feel and function complete to pass. Essentially, this image says it all both for your capstone project and future projects in your career. If image files could be made out of solid gold, it would be. Keep it in mind always.
-->
---
## Lecture Questions Emoji System

Because TA's are asked to answer all questions asynchronously when possible and because capstone issues can often take hours to address. The TA's will use slack reaction emojis to communicate the status of your question. Please pay attention to these emojis and consider them official communication. If it seems odd to take emojis seriously welcome to the tech world!

# 👀
The eyeballs mean the TA's are aware of the question and are looking into it / discussing it in the Staff Room. There may be other questions ahead of yours and it make take time to resolve the question based on the complexity of the problem and how clear the question was, if screenshots or commits were provided etc.

# ✅
The green check means that a TA or the student has confirmed that the question has been resolved. If this isn't correct tag one of the TA's in the thread or re-post the question.

# ☑️
The gray or blue check means the question seems to have been resolved by a TA or other student but is awaiting some form of confirmation.

# ⚠️ or ❌
The alert emoji means the question may not be specific enough or may not show clear evidence of independent student research on AAO, Stack Overflow, Google etc. Please do not interpret this in any negative way. Do not hesitate to ask questions, TA's are here to help and guide in answering questions. Fomulating good questions is a great skill to aquire as a software engineer and it does take practice. So, don't hesitate!

Before the TA's can effectively address the question, the student will need to add more information, screenshots, a description of what you have done so far in terms of research and solution attempts and/or a link to the repo with a recent commit message clearly describing the issue.

Once you have revised the question, tag the TAs or re-post a new version of the question in the lecture questions channel.

### Good Question Template

To ensure the quickest possible response to a question you are encouraged to literally copy, paste and fill this out when asking a question in slack. The Mod 7 team may ask you to do so if it seems like it might help expedite answering your question.

1. What feature/task are you working on? (modals, API routes, React components, Reducer, etc)
2. Describe the problem (what are you trying to do? what is it currently doing?)
3. What error messages do you have? (server/front-end console, *if there is one*)
4. What have you done to debug? What have you searched/tried? (THIS IS VERY HELPFUL TO DESCRIBE)
5. Relevant code snippets/screenshots (crop, mark-up, or explain them)
---

## Capstone Scorecards

All students should have access to their own scorecards. Inside the "capstone tab" in that Google Spreadsheet, students will fill out Student Name, Project Advisor, Application Name, Github Link, Live Link, Feature 1, Feature 2, Feature 3, Feature 4, Feature 5, and Feature 6. Your PM will ensure that the capstone scorecard is filled out accordingly as they will be utilized for future grading purposes.

---

# Phase 2 - Project Development

## Daily Standups

This will **begin on W21D3**. You will have daily stand ups with your Project Manager. Daily standups will take place between groups of 3-5 students from your circle. <!-- Each student will take roughly 5-10 minutes to screen-share their **deployed app** and **code**. Students are expected to explain what they worked on Heroku and then explain the code and data-flow afterwards. Specific standup times will always be announced in your circle channel. Your PM will ask a small handful of questions while taking brief notes that are shared with the rest of the module 7 team as well as the PTMs and the Career Quest team. -->
Each student will take 3-6 minutes to screen-share their deployed app and potentially demo any deployed feature. Standup times will always be announced in your circle channel. Your PM will ask a small handful of questions while taking brief notes that are shared with the rest of the module 7 team.

### Questions For Students:

*Please note that all work must be shown on the deployed website, not localhost. We can not determine the progression of your project based on localhost alone*

* What progress did you make on your goal from yesterday?
* What is your goal for today that you plan to complete before next standup? 
* Do you foresee any potential blockers?

### Additional Questions That May Be Asked For Students:
* When did you last deploy?
* Is all the code you are showing deployed?
* Does your Project Manager approve of the goal?
* What is your project status in terms of user stories?
* Can you demo any CRUD of the feature on the UI?

### Other Standup Notes

* If **technical questions come up**, your PM will ask you to put them in the lecture questions channel as we will not have time to debug during standups.
* TA notes will include whether you met yesterdays goal fully / partially / not at all.
* TA notes will also include 3-5 word description of your goal for tomorrow.

## Workflow Expectations

### Complete ONE FEATURE before moving on to the next.
* Expected General Workflow:
    * DB Tables => Backend Routes => Frontend Components => Error Handling => Styling

> This general workflow is what's to be expected and will help with understanding how the data flow works from the backend to the frontend.
    
### CSS Styling
* Do not leave any default styling for HTML elements such as buttons, inputs, textareas, etc.
* CSS must look as if you have made a valiant effort. You are not expected to be a designer, but attention to spacing, font, layout must be apparent.
* Your site must be intuitive to the user. Users must not have to hunt and guess how to navigate and use your app.

### GitHub 
* Utilize creating a KanBan Board on Github to effectively manage your time in completing tasks and objectives.
* Make sure to push to GitHub daily. *(We want to see that garden green)*
* You are encouraged to use branches to complete your features and to push to your main branch when you have working functionality.
   * Please remember to test the feature not only on local, but on Production as well to ensure it works as expected.

# Phase 2.5 - Peer Review

Peer Review will start on Thursday of the first week of capstone everyday after lunch, at 12:30 PT / 3:30 EST. This can also be viewed on the [Mod 7 Online Google Calender](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/u/0/embed?src=c_al83m9o7es4b69frh3mk41ia68@group.calendar.google.com&ctz=America/Los_Angeles) as well. Students will get assigned a pair, posted to Slack everyday, to review each other's code. Below are guidelines to help illustrate how peer review will work. Please note, during this hour, instructors will not be available for questions on Slack.

*Note- We will also do an EOD demo the day before peer review starts.*

> This exercise is helpful to practice remembering what your code does for when an interviewer or coworker asks you to explain parts of your code. Also this helps you practice _articulating_ your code which will **majorly** help you in interviews and on the job!

## Steps:

1. Choose who goes first. You each get 30 minutes and have a timer set up.
2. Find a part of your code to walk through.
    - Could be a part you are proud of, something new, your redux store, your routes, your components, your CSS, etc...
    - Could be something you are only partially done making and then go into some basic "pseudocode" of what your next steps will be.
        - Try to stay focused on code you do have, though. If your partner has a solution for a problem or something, it’s ok to discuss if it’s quick and write down notes (or plan to meet up afterward).
3. Begin walking line by line, explaining the work flow of your code.
    - You don't have to start at the very beginning of each file, but could choose which parts to go through.

## Things to consider:

1. This **IS NOT** time to debug or code.
2. Both sides are responsible for getting equal time to review.
3. Students are responsible to give and receive constructive feedback and commit to the exercise.
4. IA’s will be jumping in rooms periodically to check progress and could possibly ask questions! 
5. Students will receive strikes if not commited to the exercise *(webcam is off, no discussions, etc)*

## Tips:

1. Write down notes of things you notice about your own code.       
     - Mistakes, things you missed, things you want to change, etc...
2. Pay attention to the way your partner has coded things.
    - Seeing how others code can give new ideas! Or solve a problem you already have!
3. Please use code-centric instead of human-centric language. _(refer back to AOO, W2, HW for Wednesday, “Empathetic Communication” for a refresher!)_
4. Ask clarifying questions of your partner when they are explaining.
5. Take notice on how your partner read and understood your code so that you could gauge your work’s readability. 
6. If your partner did have a hard time reading a line/snippet of code, be sure to add comments to those to help you understand your code in the future. 
7. Take feedback as something constructive and helpful for improvement.(On the flip side, be aware of how you present constructive feedback)
8. Go through the starter project code *(user auth)* if you finish early. 

---

# Phase 3 - Feature Reviews / Final Grading

## Feature Reviews
Feature Reviews will begin on **W22D1, Monday**. There are no requirements associated with Feature Reviews and it is expected that your project will not yet be passing but it is ideal for you to have your project nearly completed so we can point out as many bugs / corrections that will help prepare for the following Monday when projects are due. And if your project passes, all you'll have to do is not break your site over the weekend! In addition, during this time, reviewing projects will be a priority over answering questions in the lecture channel. TA's will still check periodically to help answer questions, but also free feel to also help your peer's as well!

Please note that if the required minimum features are not deployed, then TA's will be unable to leave any feedback. This will be the student's responsibility over the weekend to **test** the User Auth and all features to ensure it works as expected.

## Review Your Scorecard
On Friday, please reach out to your grader to ask clarifying questions and to ensure what you need to work on over the weekend. This is optional if you don't have any questions and understand what to work on. Students are responsible for working on all the Evaluator feedback on the feature review scorecard. After fixing the corrections from the scorecard, **please test on Production** to ensure it works as expected.

### Test Test Test Your Features
* Students are **expected** and **responsible** to test their deployed app before final grading.
    * Test the CRUD functionality of all implemented features.
    * Test the User Auth (login, sign up, error validations, demo user, logout).
    * Check if the styling is consistent throughout the entire app.
    * Check to make sure error validations work as intended for user auth and all features *(check [Capstone Minimum Required Error Messages](https://github.com/whitnessme/capstone-minimum-required-error-messages) for more info)*
    * TA's will do their best to leave as much feedback as possible, however **it is your responsibility to test the functionality on your app to ensure it still works as expected**.

## Final Grade
Upon final grading, you should see two tabs at the bottom of the scorecard Google spreadsheet labeled as "Feature Review" and "final grade". Students are required to present their capstone project on their deployed website on Monday *(w23 d1)*. Students will have about 5-6 minutes to share their features and accomplishments. After presentations is over, students will transition to Career Quest, and the Mod 7 team will begin final grading students projects. <!-- TA's will revoke the shared access on scorecards and will share it again after it is graded. -->Please try to avoid watching an IA live grade, students will receive a direct message from an IA once their project has been graded. Last time to deploy any changes to the project GitHub repo will be before presentations, any changes made during grading will be **striked**.

Under the Final Grade tab, students will see the status of their project, either as "pass", "fail", or "currently grading". All students' capstone projects that is considered to be "fail" will be finalized and confirmed by a PTM. Any project that is marked as "fail", will take a capstone academic deferral. Please do not view it as a negative outcome, but as an opportunity to extend your learning to gain more mastery, which is imperative in the job search. Students will receive a Slack Message from the Module 7 Lead or Cohort Lead to discuss what the deferral process will look like.

## Future Goals After Final Grade

What to do moving forward? Well, the journey has only just begun. As you get closer to graduation, students are encourage to continue polishing up their capstone project. Students can also look at the constructive feedback left in the capstone scorecards to take into consideration to work on. Get ahead of the game, in order to be greenlit after graduation you will need to have 4 features in your projects and have the general requirements *(favicon, readme, About Me Links, etc)* be completed.

> "To become a better software engineer, is through repetition." The more features you continue to build, the more practice, the more repetition, the better you will become at building features quicker.

## What Should Be In a ReadMe?
* Project title
* Project description *(this can be a few sentences explaining what the app is)*
* Deployed Live Link
* Technologies/Frameworks Used *(Frontend and Backend)*
* MVP Core features
* Few screenshots, least *(1-2)*, to highlight the app
* Future Implementation Goals
